<p>My research interest lies in the broad areas of vegetation and climate interactions in natural and agro-ecosystems, for which I use multiple approaches including statistical analysis, remote sensing, and climate models. My previous studies specifically focused on the global forest changes and their effects on climate, the drought response of vegetation, and the urban heat island effect.</p>

<p>Current research projects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Forests and cloud interaction</li>
  <li>Climate impact of wind and solar farms</li>
  <li>Crop response to extreme climate in the USA</li>
</ul>
