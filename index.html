	<p>This personal page for Dr. Yan Li（李琰）from Beijing Normal University, China. 
	My research interest lies in the broad areas of vegetation and climate interactions in natural and agro-ecosystems, for which I use multiple approaches including statistical analysis, remote sensing, and climate models. My previous studies specifically focused on the global forest changes and their effects on climate, the drought response of vegetation, and the ur-ban heat island effect. My current research projects focused on crop yield modeling and the climate change impacts on agriculture.
