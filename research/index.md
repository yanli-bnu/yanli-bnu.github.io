Research  
My research interest lies in the broad areas of vegetation and climate by combining a variety of statistical/mathematical techniques, geospatial analyses, big earth data (remote sensing), and ecosystem/climate/earth system modeling. My work aims to address the sustainability challenges of the coupled human-natural systems through the lenses of vegetation-climate interaction with broad implications in forestry, renewable energy, and food systems. My previous work revealed the biophysical mechanism of how global forest cover changes affect local climate, discovered the important vegetation feedbacks of renewable energy on climate, and advanced mechanistic understanding of the response of natural and agricultural ecosystems to extreme climates.
* Vegetation and climate interactions
